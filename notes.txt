Events inconsistent - in some places you get the data you need (itemLink e.g. from Api call)
but in others you have to parse out a string manually (eg. CHAT_MSG_LOOT). Need to tie info
across multiple domains/topics (e.g. chat, merchant, cash ...)

Stringing workflow across events -- see ITEM_LOCKED, DESTROY_ITEM_CONFIRM and BAG_UPDATE requires some
state management ... inevitably bug-prone if the player can do multiple things at the same
time.

No debugging environment, no compiletime checks or real intellisense. Patchy crowdsourced
documentation and /etrace.

Lua. In Lua you have to define local functions before using them. OMG. Old school.
